This is a master thesis about creating the Next Generation of Networked Games, in the process of being translated (from the original Croatian version to English) and produced in to a video series format.  

Received a Epic Games Mega Grant.

Notes: 
* The public use of Spatial OS has effectively been discontinued by Improbable, therefore the project files cannot currently be executed. This page is to serve as a guide for using similar architectures.
* There have been corrections made to the original thesis and the wiki is to serve as a final version.
